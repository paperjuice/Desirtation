# Game summary
   The genre of the game is roguelike because of the permanant death, random generated maps and high emphasise on exploring and descovery. </br>
   The main mechanic in the game is the absence of the MC's health points. Instead, the main character gets old every second or when it gets damaged. </br>
   Health influences 3 main stats: youthfulness, fortitude and wisdom and get more potent based on the age you are at. </br>
   The game offers you possibilities to gain or lose age, thus being able to influence specific bonuses. </br>
   The game also features an online data-base for keeping track of top 20 highest scores. </br>
   Every successful action in the game gives you score. While the score itself is not relevant to the gameplay, it helps to keep track of how far other players got. </br>
